## ⚠️ Alpha Notice

> **This project is currently in early alpha development and is NOT usable for production.**
>
> The alpha version is designed so that miners can test and report all bugs through our [Bug Bounty Program](https://github.com/PlatformNetwork/bounty-challenge).
>
> Commits will be **very frequent** during the alpha phase. Expect rapid updates and breaking changes as we iterate quickly toward a stable release.
>
> **No pre-built binaries will be published during the alpha.** Developers must build the project themselves from source.

## Vision

Cortex IDE aims to be the most complete IDE for AI, specialized in **agent orchestration**. Unlike traditional IDEs with AI bolted on, Cortex IDE is built AI-first — every feature is designed around intelligent agent workflows.

### Detailed Roadmap

| Date | Milestone | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Feb 20, 2026** | Project kickoff — Alpha development begins | ✅ Done |
| **Feb 20–28** | Integrate all AI aspects into the IDE | 🔄 In Progress |
| **Feb 20–28** | Agent orchestration system | 🔄 In Progress |
| **Feb 28, 2026** | IDE functional and usable for testing | 📋 Planned |
| **March 2026+** | Beta release, stability improvements, community feedback | 📋 Planned |

### February Goals

- **Full AI Integration**: Embed AI capabilities deeply into every layer of the IDE — code completion, agent chat, inline suggestions, and autonomous task execution.
- **Agent Orchestration**: Build a first-class orchestration system to manage, coordinate, and monitor multiple AI agents working in parallel.
- **Functional IDE by end of February**: The IDE will be functional enough to be used and tested by the community.
